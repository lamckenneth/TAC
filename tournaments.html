					<p>The TAC Ladder Tournament, newly implemented for the first time this semester, allows interested participants to test their skills against others in the same division.

Each team will play 2 men's doubles and 2 mixed doubles matches against 2 other teams in a round-robin fashion to determine the ultimate winner at the end of the day. The WTT Tournament is governed each semester by a specific theme; participants, under the guidance of the captains, will need to dress up in costumes relevant to the theme. Costumes, as well as sportsmanship and spirit, will be included in the final score tally.</p>
