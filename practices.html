					<p>Practices in Tennis at Cal are a time for tennis players to not only hone their skills, but to also have fun and socialize with others. We pride ourselves for having fun and active practices that stimulate all participants and boils their blood to their very core. In order to maximize participation and fun for all players, Tennis at Cal is split into four divisions based on a player's skill level and experience. So whether you are new to tennis and want to learn the game or an old veteran looking for other players to hit with, Tennis at Cal is the place for you.</p> 

					<p>You can join Tennis at Cal any time during the semester by handing in our form and paying the membership fee of only $10 to any officer at any practice (more information can be found on the announcements page)! After, you can immediately start hitting with us and meeting other amazing tennis players!</p>
