						After thoroughly searching far and wide across the entirety of the UC Berkeley campus, TAC has acccumulated the finest team of officers any tennis club may ask for. These brave individuals survived a rigorous interview process that rivals that of Google, Goldman Sachs, and Apple combined, and truly displayed the quintessential qualities required to become a leader of TAC. Indespendible characteristics such as friendliness, dedication, attractiveness, and skill were not only apparent within this team but absolutely accentuated. The people of this board are here to serve the members of TAC and will respond to any question or request without hesitation. Whether you are an old veteran of the club, a new member, or even a bystander debating on joining, please do not be afraid to approach and have a friendly chat with any of these officers.

						<p>Jack is a pre-law sophomore from Vancouver, Canada currently pursuing a double-major in English and History. He enjoys watching mind-boggling movies and is always delighted to be the recipient of good food. The competitive and heated atmosphere on the tennis court is what drives his enjoyment for the sport; tightly contested matches are his favourites, both to watch (Roger Federer is king) and to participate in.</p>

						<p>The vitality and charisma of the officers first attracted him to Tennis At Cal in his first semester attending the school. TAC became more and more like a second home, encouraging him to take the plunge and become an officer last semester. He took on the role of president to continue to improve the social and competitive environment of the club, welcoming any and all new faces along the way.</p>

						<p>Jane is a fourth year Integrative Biology major from Tallahassee, FL. She played 2 years of JV and 1 year of varsity tennis in high school, but didn't start improving in tennis until she joined TAC spring semester of her sophomore year. Initially, Jane feared joining TAC, because she didn't know anyone in the club, but she wanted to play tennis on a regular basis. After meeting encouraging and friendly people, she decided to stay in the club. Because of the great experiences she's had since joining TAC, she decided to become an officer in hopes to contribute to similarly great experiences for others in the club. Fun facts about Jane: She's an experimental cook and loves to knit.</p>

						<p>Kenneth is the devilishly handsome Webmaster of TAC this semester. He found himself bored one day and decided to join the club. But little did he know, the organization would become his first true love. After being in TAC for less than half a semester, Kenneth decided to put his computer science skills to good use and build this very website for the club. He was happy to be able to contribute to the group and family he loves with all his heart, and looks forward to help organize and lead such a wonderful organization with the greatest team of officers he can ever ask for.</p>

						<p>Outside of TAC, Kenneth loves to eat, sleep, and do nothing. He hails from the foreign land of San Diego where the weather is always perfect and the Mexican food is top notch. His favorite foods consist of the California Burrito, In 'n Out, and his mom's Chinese fried rice. Other than tennis, Kenneth enjoys snowboarding, jamming on the ukulele, and playing tennis. He just loves tennis. So much.</p>

						<p>Lawrence went to high school in England and has spent a lot of his free time playing racquet sports such as badminton, squash etc... But he was never really into tennis until his last semester in high school when he started to pay more attention to tennis matches and it's history.</p>

						<p>He is a loyal and undying supporter of the one and only Roger Federer (also known as the Swiss Maestro, the Fedmeister, the G.O.A.T) because in his opinion Federer is the perfect sportsman on and off court and he is also a great role model. Lawrence believes in improving and honing his skills in tennis in order to become "#betterer", and his favourite shot is "the tweener".</p>

     					<p>Lisa has been a member of Tennis at Cal for one year and decided to join the elite board because of her love for the sport itself, the people, and the opportunity to socialize more with all the members. The past social events in the fall of 2014 were extremely fun and she hopes that this spring's events will be equally wonderful!</p>
     					
     					<p>Random facts about Lisa: She's a second year at Cal (intended MCB major) who loves alpacas, dogs, Hayao Miyazaki, Adventure Time, Christopher Nolan, eating, and sleeping. She's been playing tennis on and off for around 8 years, but doesn't seem to have improved much....</p>

						<p>Chris was first enchanted at the magic of TAC by the natural charismatic leadership of Jack Chai. Despite four years of high school tennis experience, he hadn't seen anything quite like the social yet competitive atmosphere of TAC. Whether it was drawing lipstick kisses, spontaneous karaoke, or just injuring himself on the courts, Chris found himself pulled into the world of TAC as a lowly, lonely freshman. After seeing how all-powerful, yet benevolent the officers of TAC are, Chris thought to himself, "I want a slice of that pie." The way they made sure everyone had a good time at practice was something that he wanted to try himself, and the previous officers were foolish enough to give him a shot.</p>
						
						<p>Outside of hitting yellow balls over nets with funny-looking sticks, Chris enjoys following sports, is a prospective Statistics major (he thinks), and thinks that Rafael Nadal winning the French Open every year is boring.</p>

						<p>Jeanine is an East coast native and has been playing tennis for over seven years. Before coming to Berkeley, she was a team co-captain of her high school varsity team and played doubles for two years. She joined Tennis at Cal as a way to continue tennis and keep active. What she did not expect to find, however, was a fantastic group of people with a passion for tennis and a unique sense of humor that kept her coming back to TAC events. She became an officer this semester in hopes of meeting more people and putting her past coaching experience to good use by teaching those that are new to tennis.</p>

						<p>Off the court, Jeanine can be found reading or watching Netflix (more likely). She is an avid art-lover, having done some art herself for many years, and also enjoys visiting museums, exploring San Francisco, and hiking in the mountains.</p>

Although she was rough and tough, Debbie did her job well and she loved all the members equally. However, now that she does not have any responsibility in TAC, she is taking her time writing her actual biography. The real biography will be coming soon!

						<p>He began playing tennis at a young age as he and his family shared a passion for the game. In the early days, he brought an explosive mix of natural instincts and a sporadic temper onto the court. The combination was a double-edged sword that made the probability of rising to the top and crashing into oblivion equally likely. This marked the making of a true legend, Roger Federer.</p>
						
						<p>Enter Tony, who at the age of ten boarded FedEx (Federer Express), an unassailable hype train led by the maestro himself. Both Roger and Tony were transformed by the game. Through playing tennis, Federer matured into a gracious champion. At the same time, Tony discovered the magic of TAC, a place where countless tweeners are attempted, balls shanked, and friendships forged.</p>
