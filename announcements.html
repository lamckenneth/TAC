						April 27th, 2015

					<div class="message">
						As sad as this is, all good things must come to an end. Today marks the end to the TAC Ladder Tournament for the spring semester. After battling it out for months, the results are as follows:

						<p>D1
						<br>Champion: Christian Waters
						<br>Runner-up: Ryan Bilotta</p>

						<p>D2/3/4
						<br>Champion: Lawrence Xue
						<br>Runner-up: Miguel Flores</p>
						
						<p>A great big thank you to everyone who played in the tournament this semester. Without your participation, the revamping of the ladder tournament would never have been this successful. I hope to see more people join the ladder in future semesters. Thank you, and have a good night!</p>

						Congratulations Benedict and Ladder Tournament Update
					</div>
					<div class="date">
						April 19th, 2015
					</div>
					<div class="message">
						First of all, enormous congrats to our very own Benedict Llave for officially being voted in as an ASUC Senator!!!!!!! I'm certain he shall go on to do great and wonderful things to remain forever in ASUC history.

						<p>In sadder news, the ladder tournament is coming to an end this Sunday. In order to determine the champions of the D1 bracket and D2/3/4 bracket, the number 1 and 2 ranked players from each ladder will play a 3-set 'Final' match, with ads, on Monday, April 27th 7pm. Spectators are highly encouraged!</p>

						<p>There is only one more week left to challenge, so get that ranking up and fight for the top! The true champions will be revealed in the aftermath of a grueling affair that is bound to shock and delight all those fortunate enough to be present.</p>

						<p>Have a great week, good luck with the ladder, and congratulations to Benedict again!
						<br>*If one of the players cannot make the scheduled time, then an alternate arrangement will be made.</p>

						Hi Everyone!

						<p>The semester is coming to an end, but we're going to go out with a bang. The final TAC tournament of this semester, the World Team Tennis Tournament(WTT), will be held on May 2. This is the first Saturday after classes end, so let's have one more Hoorah before buckling down and studying hard. For those of you new to TAC, talk to old members to find out how exciting this tournament is. Members will be split into teams led by an officer and will battle other teams in a round robin style. But that's not all! Costumes, as well as sportsmanship and spirit, will be included in the final score tally. Everyone sign up, because we're playing traditional tennis with a spin(pun not intended).</p>

						<p>We have decided to move the cut-off for World Team Tennis Tournament sign-ups to this Wednesday, April 15 at 11:59pm. I apologize for the short notice, but we believe this will give teams more time to interact, practice, and prepare for the tournament. I've linked the google form. I highly encourage everyone of all divisions to join! Thanks for being flexible. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
